# ChallengeSuprnation

First off all you should run `npm run install` to install all the necessary packages

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng start` or `npm run start` to run the project


# Challenge Tasks
I merged the task A , B and C because C needed the logic from A and B

For those tasks I tried to use a regex, but I'm not very use to, so I tried another approach that worked. Basically I used a function that tries to run a function an only can do it if that function was valid (check where for more details https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function)

For task D I didn't try to do something pretty, just functional and responsive

If you have any doubt about something, please feel free to contact me

Thank you
